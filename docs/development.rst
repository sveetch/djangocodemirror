djangocodemirror is developed with:

* *Test Development Driven* (TDD) using `Pytest`_;
* Respecting flake and pip8 rules using `Flake8`_;
* `Sphinx`_ for documentation with enabled `Napoleon`_ extension (using only the *Google style*);

    mkdir djangocodemirror-dev
    cd djangocodemirror-dev

djangocodemirror will be installed in editable mode from the last commit on master branch.

You will need an additional Python2.7 to be able to launch tests with every `tox`_ environments.

Unittests
---------

Unittests are made to works on `Pytest`_, a shortcut in Makefile is available to start them on your current development install: ::

    sudo pip install tox

    tox
